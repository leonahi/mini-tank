mini-tank
=========
Coder: Nahit Pawar - Institute of Instrumentation Engineering
IDE used: Borland Turbo C++
Platform: Microsoft Windows

Mini Tank game written in C using windows 16-bit graphics.

This was my first game which is coded and developed,  
when I was enjoying my first year summer holidays of my B.Tech in 2008. 
It was written using Borland's Turbo C++ IDE.
The theme is like this - You have your tank and aliens can appear anywhere from left to right with random speed. 
The task is you have 14 shoot to kill 14 aliens.
At the time of development the only thing I knew was Logic operation, Functions and 16-bit windows graphics so it was a very big thing for me at that time.
